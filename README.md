A Transwing UAV representation both in blender and URDF, this repo is just a showcase of a complicated UAV design in URDF. Phobos add-on was used within blender to convert the 3D model into a URDF representation. 

The matlab demo only displays the model moving the joints, no simulation neither a transition was made in matlab:
